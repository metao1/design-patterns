# Design patterns

1) Adapter: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
2) Builder: Builder is a creation design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
3) Command: Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

4) Decorator: Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

5) Factory: Factory Method is a creation design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

6) Observer: Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

7) State: State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.

8) Facade: Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.
