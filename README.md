# Design patterns in Java

1) Adapter: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

2) Abstract Factory: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

3) Bridge: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

4) Composite: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

5) Flyweight: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

6) Prototype: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

7) Adapter: Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

8) State: State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.

9) Command: Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

10) Decorator: Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

11) Factory: Factory Method is a creation design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

12) Observer: Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

13) Facade: Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.
